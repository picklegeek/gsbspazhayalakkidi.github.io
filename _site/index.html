					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>
						<li>It is often remarked that groups are everywhere, whether in our social lives, our work lives, or even our families. In each of these situations, sets of individuals decide to work collectively to achieve particular goals.

However, although groups are everywhere and we participate in them constantly, we do not understand them very well. </li>

<li>The study of groups as a phenomenon that is unique and different from other social phenomena is very active, reflecting both the importance it has and how much we still don't know about groups.</li>

						<h2>What is a group?</h2>
						<p><ul><li>Groups are a fundamental part of social life.</li><br><li>A collection of individuals who have regular contact and frequent interaction, mutual influence, common feeling of camaraderie, and who work together to achieve a common set of goals.</li>
						<br>
					<li>They can be highly rewarding to their members and to society as a whole, but there are also significant problems and dangers with them. All this makes them an essential focus for research, exploration and action.</li></ul></p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Studies on groups</h2>
						<p>In a famous piece Lewin(founder of social psychology) wrote, ‘it is not similarity or dissimilarity of individuals that constitutes a group, but interdependence of fate’</p>
						<br><h5>Jarlath F. Benson identified group attributes as:</h5>
						<p><ul><li>A set of people engage in frequent interactions</li>
							<li>They identify with one another.</li>
							<li>They are defined by others as a group.</li>
							<li>They share beliefs, values, and norms about areas of common interest.</li>
							<li>They define themselves as a group.</li>
							<li>They come together to work on common tasks and for agreed purposes.</li></ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why Groups form?</h2>
						<h4>Social Exchange Theory</h4>
						<p>It is based on expectation of mutual benefit. Reward from interactions are percieved more valuable than cost incured and time spent in group activities.</p>
						<ul><li>Examples include Political parties, work groups, etc..</li></ul>
						<br><br>
						<h4>Social Identity Theory</h4>
						<p>Members get a sence of identity and positive self image by being in a group. examples include Religious groups, ethnic groups, </p>

					<h2>What is a team?</h2>
					<p>
						<ul><li>A team is a small group of individuals working together to achieve a common goal.</li><br>
						<li>Members of a team usually have complimantary skills and therefore a high degree of interdependance.</li><br>
						<li>Through coordination the performance of the whole team becomes better than the individuals performance. </li></ul>
